Compiling the C files
----------------------------

- SimpServer.c and SimpClient.c and other C file compilation is done 
  using the included makefile.
  
- To run the makefile ensure you are in the assignment directory in your
  terminal window and run the simple command "make".
  
- Example of running the code: 
    ~/Assn1$ make

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Using SimpClient.c
----------------------------

- SimpClient.c is an HTTP Client which is able to send a simple HTTP 'GET'
  request to a server and print out the returned HTTP header and body.
  
- After the file has been been compiled it can be run from the terminal
  window.  This program takes 1 command line argument which is a Uniform
  Resource Identifier (URI) of the form "protocol://host[:port]/filepath".
  The 'protocol' must be of type 'http' or the URI will not be accepted.
  
- Examples of running the client: 
    ~/Assn1 ./SimpClient http://10.10.1.100:8888/index.html
    ~/Assn1 ./SimpClient http://www.csc.uvic.ca/index.htm
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Using SimpServer.c
----------------------------

- SimpServer.c is an HTTP Server which is able to receive HTTP 1.0 'GET'
  requests from SimpClient.c and return to the client it's requested file.
  
- After the file has been compiled it can be run from the terminal window.
  This program takes 2 command line arguments which consists of a port number
  that the server will attempt to listen on and and a directory name which
  the server will grab files to pass from.
  
- Examples of running the server:
    ~/Assn1 ./SimpServer 8888 web
